Portland may have the single best alternative news weekly on the planet. The [Willamette Week](http://www.wweek.com) is no joke.

<!--more-->

It's the only print news product I still consume regularly. Ann and I used to be regular newspaper subscribers. Then just the Sunday version. Now we don't pay for a single subscription. Instead, Ann just picks up a free copy of WWeek when she's over in the Pearl each Wednesday.

It has everything I need for a news weekly: Hard Portland news edited by a Pulitzer winner, single-source entertainment listings, food listings out the wazoo, and not *too* many weed ads or 900 numbers. The 'missed connections' portion of the old personal ads used to be highly entertaining. That's the only thing I was was still around edition. Everything else is at its peak right now.

So keep doin' what you're doin', Willy Week!
